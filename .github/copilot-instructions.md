No unnecessary inline comments. If a comment is necessary, it should be concise and explain why the code is doing something.
No hacky solutuions. Write clean maintable production ready code.

Only commit things if I explicitly tell you.
If you commit something use semantic commit messages. Keep the commit message concise. Try to logically separate commits, but also do not be to granular - no 10 line diff commits, but also no 2000 line diff commits.
